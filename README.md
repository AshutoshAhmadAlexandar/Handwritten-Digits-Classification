# Handwritten-Digits-Classification
- Implement a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and evaluate its performance in classifying handwritten digits.
- Use the same network to analyze a more challenging face dataset and compare the performance of the neural network against a deep neural network using the TensorFlow library.
